Tests
-----

Quickly run the test suite for the default target.
> dotnet test src\Abc.Tests -c Release

Beware, will crash if the packages were not correctly restored before
(correctly because we seem to have a problem since we enabled .NET 4.6.1).

Multi-targeting at once does not work. To test for a single framework:
> dotnet test /p:TargetFramework=net461

Beware, we CANNOT write:
> dotnet test -f net461
because "net461" is not listed as a supported framework within the project file.

Filtering
> dotnet test --filter Category=XXXX
> dotnet test --filter Priority!=XXX -v q

Dump the test suite.
> dotnet test --list-tests

Benchmarks
> dotnet run -c Release -p perf
