README
------

The actual test project is not here but in "src" and is called Abc.Tests.

Projects here are meant to work with "eng\post-check.ps1".

Of course, one can still use the dotnet command-line directly:
> dotnet build NETSdk
> dotnet build NETSdk /p:__Max=true
> dotnet test NETSdk -f net48
Beware, this won't work with the projects NET45 and NET451 which use pre-SDK
project files.
