The actual test project is not here but in src\Abc.Tests.

Projects here are meant to work with eng\post-check.ps1.

Of course, one can still use the dotnet command-line directly:
> dotnet build NETSdk
> dotnet test NETSdk -f net48
Beware, this won't work with the projects NET45 and NET451 which use pre-SDK
project files.
