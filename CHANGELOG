Changelog for Abc.Maybe.

vNEXT

  Internal changes.
  * Settings:
    - Projects in the folder "test" now use an exact version match when
      resolving the package Abc.Maybe; see `AbcPackageRange` in test\D.B.targets.
    - New global option `vNext` to tweak the version numbers __locally__; see
      src\Retails.props.
    - Merge option `Retail` with the configuration Release.
    - When targetting .NET Framework, always set `DebugType` to "pdbonly"; see
      D.B.targets. This was previously only the case for projects in the folder
      "src". Beware, for Coverlet to work properly, one should override this
      behaviour from the command-line by setting `DebugType` to "portable".
  * Scripts:
    - pack.ps1: always set `ContinuousIntegrationBuild` to "true", and set
      `vNext` to "true" when building a local package.
  * New development dependency:
    - Abc.Utilities.Sources.
  * Upgraded dependencies:
    - xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.4.2 -> 2.4.3.

2020-06-16, version 1.0.2

  Visible changes.
  * Remove "net452", replaced by "netstandard1.1" (should happen automatically).

  Internal changes.
  * Set up GitHub actions and Azure Pipelines. The main outcome is that the
    tests now execute on Windows, Linux and MacOS.
  * Settings:
    - Always enable "coverlet.collector" and only reference "coverlet.msbuild"
      when explicitly requested; see src\Abc.Tests\Abc.Tests.csproj.
    - When enabled, Source Link now processes all projects in the folder "src".
    - Tweak package and platform selections for projects src\Abc.Tests and
      test\Package; see src\Abc.Tests\PackageReferences.targets.
  * Scripts:
    - harness.cmd: new script to quickly run the test suite.
  * Upgraded dependencies:
    - xunit.runner.visualstudio 2.4.1 -> 2.4.2.
    - dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool 4.5.8 -> 4.6.1.

2020-05-31, version 1.0.1

  Visible changes.
  * For older Windows-only platforms, use "pdbonly" instead of "portable".

  Internal changes.
  * Scripts:
    - asm.ps1: new script to retrieve informations about an assembly.
    - cover.ps1: when using Coverlet, include the platform name in the output
      filename.
    - freeze-api.ps1: handle the annotation `#nullable enable`.
    - pack.ps1: disable Source Link when there are uncommited changes.
      Remove the timestamp from the informational version.
  * Upgraded dependencies:
    - coverlet.msbuild 2.8.1 -> 2.9.0.
