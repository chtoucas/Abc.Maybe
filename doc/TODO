TODO
====

Code
----

- Add overloads w/ IEqualityComparer<T> (true structural comparison).
- LINQ: optimize, more ops.
  "Monadic" LINQ. Output Maybe<IEnumerable<T>> and LINQ ops.
- Async Enumerable.
- Utilities to write code in the ROP style (Railway Oriented Programming).
- Serialization (XML)
-  Misc.
  * FIXME, TODO and REVIEW within the code.
  * Localise user messages (ExceptionFactory)?

Tools
-----

- MSBuild
  * Add quotes, not a priority...
  * Property "RestoreSources" in "test".
- Scripts
  * Add option -Verbosity?
  * cover.ps1 add option -MyVerbose
  * Verbosity tweaks: -v minimal /p:PrintSettings=true.
    cover.ps1, AZP and test-package.ps1.
- EnableSourceLink no longer prevents coverlet to run, but it fails when we set
  UseSourceLink=true (see cover.ps1 & coverlet.runsettings).
- Roslyn Analyzer:
  * Of(), Flatten(). Squash(Maybe<T?>) where T : class
  * SelectMany(), ZipWith(), Bind().
- Perf tool (LINQ, nulls, iterable), .NET Core tool for benchmarkdotnet.


Testing
-------

Testing is well underway but there is still a lot to be done.
Fixed naming schema, split tests, more functional tests.

- MaybeComparer<T>, proper testing of equality and ordering comparisons.
  Expand comparison tests (order and equality). See NONGENERIC_MAYBE
  Structural comparisons w/ structural types.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968580/why-arent-istructuralequatable-and-istructuralcomparable-generic
- Maybe<Func<>>
- delegates that return null.

We still cannot target UAP. It seems that it could be doable with .NET 5.

Documentation
-------------

XML comments with complete examples.
Help: https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/wiki
When done, configure Abc.Maybe to wanr on missing XML comments.

Sample code w/ C#, VB and F#.

A bit of marketing, compare to other option types.

"Lifted" comparison T w/ Maybe<T> to handle mixed type, eg Maybe<int?>,
Maybe<int>, int? and int. See custom MaybeComparer<T>. Do not implement
IEquatable<T> (T == Maybe<T>), IComparable<T> this would be misleading?

Struct really? Explain and compare to ValueTuple.

Nullable attributes and notnull constraint.
It would make a lot of sense to add a notnull constraint on the T of Maybe<T>,
but it worries me a bit (I need to gain more experience with the new NRT). It
would allow to warn a user trying to create a Maybe<int?> or a Maybe<string?>.

Azure pipelines (CI)
--------------------

Include instead of Exclude? Artifacts retention?
Release pipeline, test all supported platforms?

NuGet caching?
<PropertyGroup Condition=" $(ContinuousIntegrationBuild) == 'true' ">
  <RestorePackagesWithLockFile>true</RestorePackagesWithLockFile>
  <RestoreLockedMode>true</RestoreLockedMode>
  <DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>true</DisableImplicitNuGetFallbackFolder>
  <!--<NoWarn>NU1603</NoWarn>-->
</PropertyGroup>

Linux job?
