TODO
====

Pack (determinism): changelog + explain + clean up developer notes.

Source Link
- Move conf from Abc.Maybe.csproj to D.B.(props/targets)?
- snupkg? It requires the user to configure the NuGet.org symbol server in VS.

vNEXT
-----

- MaybeComparer<T>, proper testing of equality and ordering comparisons.
- Add overloads w/ IEqualityComparer<T> (true structural comparison).
- "Lifted" comparison T w/ Maybe<T> to handle mixed type, eg Maybe<int?>,
  Maybe<int>, int? and int. This should be a custom MaybeComparer<T>. Do not
  implement IEquatable<T> (T == Maybe<T>), IComparable<T> this would be misleading?
- More May helpers w/ Span<T>.
- LINQ: optimize, more ops.
  "Monadic" LINQ. Output Maybe<IEnumerable<T>> and LINQ ops.
- Utilities to write code in the ROP style (Railway Oriented Programming).
- Extensions.
- Async (configurable, enumerable).
- Roslyn Analyzer:
  * Of(), Flatten(). Squash(Maybe<T?>) where T : class
  * SelectMany(), ZipWith(), Bind().
- Serialization (XML)

Misc tasks.
- FIXME, TODO and REVIEW within the code.
- Localise user messages (ExceptionFactory)?
- Perf tool (LINQ, nulls, iterable), .NET Core tool for benchmarkdotnet.
- BannedApiAnalyzers?
- Replace coverlet.msbuild by coverlet-console? Use runsettings.
  Add coverlet.collector to the test project. Coverity?
  xunit.runner.console -> core app

Building & Packaging.
- We use TargetFrameworkIdentifier ('.NETFramework') and NETFRAMEWORK instead
  of TargetFramework and NET461, is it such a good idea?
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives/preprocessor-if
- https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/31
- code coverage?
- Microsoft.NETFramework.ReferenceAssemblies
- System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe
- Old platforms?
  NetStandardImplicitPackageVersion, DisableImplicitFrameworkReferences

Testing
-------

Testing is well underway but there is still a lot to be done.

- Naming tests: explain rules in this doc and fix the tests themselves if necessary.
- Split tests.
- More functional tests.
- Expand comparison tests (order and equality).
  See NONGENERIC_MAYBE
  Structural comparisons w/ structural types.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968580/why-arent-istructuralequatable-and-istructuralcomparable-generic
- Maybe<Func<>>
- delegates that return null.
- Check published packages (upgrade, debugging experience).

Documentation
-------------

- XML comments with complete examples.
  https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/wiki
  When done, filter out Abc.Maybe in Directory.Build.targets (NoWarn), and add
  <NoWarn /> for Retail builds?
- Sample code w/ C#, VB and F#.

- A bit of marketing, compare to other option types.
- Struct really? Explain and compare to ValueTuple.

- Nullable attributes and notnull constraint.
  It would make a lot of sense to add a notnull constraint on the T of Maybe<T>,
  but it worries me a bit (I need to gain more experience with the new NRT). It
  would allow to warn a user trying to create a Maybe<int?> or a Maybe<string?>.
