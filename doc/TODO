Include instead of Exclude?
Enable Source Link for Azure?
How to speed up build time?
Linux build
Artifacts retention?

Code.
- Add overloads w/ IEqualityComparer<T> (true structural comparison).
- LINQ: optimize, more ops.
  "Monadic" LINQ. Output Maybe<IEnumerable<T>> and LINQ ops.
- Async Enumerable.
- Utilities to write code in the ROP style (Railway Oriented Programming).
- Serialization (XML)
-  Misc.
  * FIXME, TODO and REVIEW within the code.
  * Localise user messages (ExceptionFactory)?

Tools.
- Roslyn Analyzer:
  * Of(), Flatten(). Squash(Maybe<T?>) where T : class
  * SelectMany(), ZipWith(), Bind().
- Perf tool (LINQ, nulls, iterable), .NET Core tool for benchmarkdotnet.
- Instead of coverlet.msbuild, use coverlet.collector?
  Currently it cannot work since we only reference "Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk"
  when running VS.

Testing
-------

Testing is well underway but there is still a lot to be done.
Fixed naming schema, split tests, more functional tests.

- MaybeComparer<T>, proper testing of equality and ordering comparisons.
  Expand comparison tests (order and equality). See NONGENERIC_MAYBE
  Structural comparisons w/ structural types.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4968580/why-arent-istructuralequatable-and-istructuralcomparable-generic
- Maybe<Func<>>
- delegates that return null.

Documentation
-------------

XML comments with complete examples.
Help: https://github.com/dotnet/dotnet-api-docs/wiki
When done, configure Abc.Maybe to wanr on missing XML comments.

Sample code w/ C#, VB and F#.

A bit of marketing, compare to other option types.

"Lifted" comparison T w/ Maybe<T> to handle mixed type, eg Maybe<int?>,
Maybe<int>, int? and int. See custom MaybeComparer<T>. Do not implement
IEquatable<T> (T == Maybe<T>), IComparable<T> this would be misleading?

Struct really? Explain and compare to ValueTuple.

Nullable attributes and notnull constraint.
It would make a lot of sense to add a notnull constraint on the T of Maybe<T>,
but it worries me a bit (I need to gain more experience with the new NRT). It
would allow to warn a user trying to create a Maybe<int?> or a Maybe<string?>.
